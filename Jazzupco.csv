Is the flatware dishwasher safe and is it durable? While we have customers who wash this flatware in dishwashers with no issues, we cannot guarantee that the dishwasher would not affect the exterior finishes as there are various factors involved (eg. type of dishwasher, dishwasher detergent, etc.). As such, it is recommended to only handwash the flatware so as to preserve the exterior as well as possible. However, if you decide to use the dishwasher, you may try dishwashing programs with a low temperature of 104°F / 40°C or less as higher temperatures may affect the exterior quality of the flatware. Check if your dishwasher features an eco-friendly program that operates on a low temperature of 104°F / 40°C or less. You may also consider testing 1 or 2 flatware pieces in the dishwasher over a prolonged duration first (say 1 to 2 months), before putting the remaining pieces in the dishwasher. Your flatware is durable and suitable for day-to-day use as it’s made of high-quality 18/10 stainless steel, which provides the greatest resistance to corrosion and rust. What is the colored coating made of? The flatware is titanium-plated (non-toxic and safe coating) that provides additional resistance to corrosion and rust. Will the coating layer peel off and wear out after washing? No, the coating layer will not peel off and will not wear out after washing. Does the flatware have a good weight to it? Yes, our flatware is heavier than regular ones due to the thicker handles and quality materials used.

Is the flatware dishwasher safe and is it durable? While we have customers who wash this flatware in dishwashers with no issues, we cannot guarantee that the dishwasher would not affect the exterior finishes as there are various factors involved (eg. type of dishwasher, dishwasher detergent, etc.). As such, it is recommended to only handwash the flatware so as to preserve the exterior as well as possible. However, if you decide to use the dishwasher, you may try dishwashing programs with a low temperature of 104°F / 40°C or less as higher temperatures may affect the exterior quality of the flatware. Check if your dishwasher features an eco-friendly program that operates on a low temperature of 104°F / 40°C or less. You may also consider testing 1 or 2 flatware pieces in the dishwasher over a prolonged duration first (say 1 to 2 months), before putting the remaining pieces in the dishwasher. Your flatware is durable and suitable for day-to-day use as it’s made of high-quality 18/10 stainless steel, which provides the greatest resistance to corrosion and rust. What is the colored coating made of? The flatware is titanium-plated (non-toxic and safe coating) that provides additional resistance to corrosion and rust. Will the coating layer peel off and wear out after washing? No, the coating layer will not peel off and will not wear out after washing. Does the flatware have a good weight to it? Yes, our flatware is heavier than regular ones due to the thicker handles and quality materials used.

After each use, promptly wash off (using a soft sponge and do not use hot water) residues and food stains as soon as you can. While we have customers who wash this flatware in dishwashers with no issues, we cannot guarantee that the dishwasher would not affect the exterior finishes as there are various factors involved (eg. type of dishwasher, dishwasher detergent, etc.). As such, it is recommended to only handwash the flatware so as to preserve the exterior as well as possible. However, if you decide to use the dishwasher, you may try dishwashing programs with a low temperature of 104°F / 40°C or less as higher temperatures may affect the exterior quality of the flatware. Check if your dishwasher features an eco-friendly program that operates on a low temperature of 104°F / 40°C or less. You may also consider testing 1 or 2 flatware pieces in the dishwasher over a prolonged duration first (say 1 to 2 months), before putting the remaining pieces in the dishwasher. When washing, use mild dishwashing liquid only and avoid citrus-scented, chlorine-based and anti-limescale detergents. Do not use abrasive sponges or scrubs. After each wash, dry with a soft towel to prevent water marks, discoloration and film buildup. When storing your flatware pieces, place them in a dry and well-ventilated place and keep spoons and forks separately from the knives to avoid scratches on the surface.

However, if you decide to use the dishwasher, you may try dishwashing programs with a low temperature of 104°F / 40°C or less as higher temperatures may affect the exterior quality of the flatware.

After each use, promptly wash off (using a soft sponge and do not use hot water) residues and food stains as soon as you can. While we have customers who wash this flatware in dishwashers with no issues, we cannot guarantee that the dishwasher would not affect the exterior finishes as there are various factors involved (eg. type of dishwasher, dishwasher detergent, etc.). As such, it is recommended to only handwash the flatware so as to preserve the exterior as well as possible. However, if you decide to use the dishwasher, you may try dishwashing programs with a low temperature of 104°F / 40°C or less as higher temperatures may affect the exterior quality of the flatware. Check if your dishwasher features an eco-friendly program that operates on a low temperature of 104°F / 40°C or less. You may also consider testing 1 or 2 flatware pieces in the dishwasher over a prolonged duration first (say 1 to 2 months), before putting the remaining pieces in the dishwasher. When washing, use mild dishwashing liquid only and avoid citrus-scented, chlorine-based and anti-limescale detergents. Do not use abrasive sponges or scrubs. After each wash, dry with a soft towel to prevent water marks, discoloration and film buildup. When storing your flatware pieces, place them in a dry and well-ventilated place and keep spoons and forks separately from the knives to avoid scratches on the surface.

Is the flatware dishwasher safe and is it durable? While we have customers who wash this flatware in dishwashers with no issues, we cannot guarantee that the dishwasher would not affect the exterior finishes as there are various factors involved (eg. type of dishwasher, dishwasher detergent, etc.). As such, it is recommended to only handwash the flatware so as to preserve the exterior as well as possible. However, if you decide to use the dishwasher, you may try dishwashing programs with a low temperature of 104°F / 40°C or less as higher temperatures may affect the exterior quality of the flatware. Check if your dishwasher features an eco-friendly program that operates on a low temperature of 104°F / 40°C or less. You may also consider testing 1 or 2 flatware pieces in the dishwasher over a prolonged duration first (say 1 to 2 months), before putting the remaining pieces in the dishwasher. Your flatware is durable and suitable for day-to-day use as it’s made of high-quality 18/10 stainless steel, which provides the greatest resistance to corrosion and rust. What is the colored coating made of? The flatware is titanium-plated (non-toxic and safe coating) that provides additional resistance to corrosion and rust. Will the coating layer peel off and wear out after washing? No, the coating layer will not peel off and will not wear out after washing. Does the flatware have a good weight to it? Yes, our flatware is heavier than regular ones due to the thicker handles and quality materials used.

After each use, promptly wash off (using a soft sponge and do not use hot water) residues and food stains as soon as you can. While we have customers who wash this flatware in dishwashers with no issues, we cannot guarantee that the dishwasher would not affect the exterior finishes as there are various factors involved (eg. type of dishwasher, dishwasher detergent, etc.). As such, it is recommended to only handwash the flatware so as to preserve the exterior as well as possible. However, if you decide to use the dishwasher, you may try dishwashing programs with a low temperature of 104°F / 40°C or less as higher temperatures may affect the exterior quality of the flatware. Check if your dishwasher features an eco-friendly program that operates on a low temperature of 104°F / 40°C or less. You may also consider testing 1 or 2 flatware pieces in the dishwasher over a prolonged duration first (say 1 to 2 months), before putting the remaining pieces in the dishwasher. When washing, use mild dishwashing liquid only and avoid citrus-scented, chlorine-based and anti-limescale detergents. Do not use abrasive sponges or scrubs. After each wash, dry with a soft towel to prevent water marks, discoloration and film buildup. When storing your flatware pieces, place them in a dry and well-ventilated place and keep spoons and forks separately from the knives to avoid scratches on the surface.
